Features
- speed limit downloads (see https://github.com/shoichikaji/HTTP-Tiny-Bandwidth, now in CPAN)

Refinements
- move all log_and_croak type functions up to Repositorio.pm, just log info and debug in plugins, then croak() and let upstream decide.
- move HTTP::Tiny out of Base and make protocol handling modular
- make --arch optional if only one arch configured for the repo (globally)
- add a tag delete option (have it check for soft tags pointing at hard tags before deletion)

Documentation
- document how to have apache (and others) ask caches not do cache the contents of repodata/ (Yum)
- document how to have squid (and others) never cache the contents of repodata/ (Yum)
