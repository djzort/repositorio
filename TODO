- move all log_and_croak type functions up to Repositorio.pm, just log info and debug in plugins, then croak() and let upstream decide.
- allow multiple mirrors (falls back from one to the next) as per https://github.com/RexOps/repositorio/issues/25
- speed limit downloads (see https://github.com/shoichikaji/HTTP-Tiny-Bandwidth, not yet in CPAN)
- document how to have apache (and others) ask caches not do cache the contents of repodata/ (Yum)
- document how to have squid (and others) never cache the contents of repodata/ (Yum)
- move HTTP::Tiny out of Base and make protocol handling modular
